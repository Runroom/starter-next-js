## Setting up your local repo
This starter uses **NPM** to manage dependencies and **Node version >= 20** to be executed. In order to clone and start it you can use this following commnads in your local machine:

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
