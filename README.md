## Setting up your local repo
This starter uses **NPM** to manage dependencies and **Node version >= 20** to be executed. In order to clone and start it you can use this following commnads in your local machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Runroom/starter-next-js.git
cd starter-next-js

This will leave everything ready to checkout your localhost starter site. To run your localhost environment you can use the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
```

After this command execution **you can access** `http://localhost:3000` with your browser and see the initial page.


## Local Development
When developing with this starter you can the following command to **enable a development environment** and **live reload** to see your code changes instantly affecting the frontend:

```bash

```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
